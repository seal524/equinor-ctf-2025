## Challenge

It's a Tangram Puzzle.
Create two random shapes out of the shapes available.
EPT team will randomly give you the shapes to complete.
The puzzle blocks and shapes look like this 3D model: https://www.printables.com/model/29046-tangram-puzzle

## Process

Analyzing the pieces, you notice that you have two large triangles and three pieces that match the size of the triangle.
This helps deduce what is possible to create based on mathematical properties. 
With some RNG, analysis of shapes, deduction and trial and error, you can identify where some shapes can and can't go.
This made the process easier and you could solve it relatively simply.

You get the flag `EPT{l00k_wh4t_1_m4d3!}`
