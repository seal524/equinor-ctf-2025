## Challenge

Spin the wheel for a flag (or at least part of it)

## Process

We analyzed the script and found that completing a survey allows you to spin the wheel and give you a chance to win part of a flag. The probability of this is quite low `WIN_PROBABILITY", "0.05`.
Meaning that the best way is to brute force it and keep spinning.

To get a spin you have to have a unique UUID, so we created a script that would automatically take a survey and spin the wheel. 
Looking at `main.py` we know that it will return a json blob containing either `"result": "no_flag"` or `"result": "flag"`.
This is shown here:

```python
if won:
global win_counter
flag_parts = split_flag_into_parts(FLAG)
current_part = flag_parts[win_counter % 3]
win_counter += 1

part_number = ((win_counter - 1) % 3) + 1

return {
        "result": "flag",
        "flag": current_part,
        "message": f"🎉 Congratulations! You won part {part_number}/3 of the flag!",
}
else:
return {
        "result": "no_flag",
        "message": "Better luck next time! Thanks for spinning.",
}
```

So we created a brute force script that would keep spinning until we saw anything else than `no_flag`.
The script is added [here](solve.py).
We just ran it in the background until we got all three parts `EPT{sp1n_th3_wh33l_0f_vuln3r4b1l1ty}`.

```
{
  "result": "flag",
  "flag": "EPT{sp1n_th3_w",
  "message": "\ud83c\udf89 Congratulations! You won part 1/3 of the flag!"
}
{
  "result": "flag",
  "flag": "h33l_0f_vu",
  "message": "\ud83c\udf89 Congratulations! You won part 2/3 of the flag!"
}
{
  "result": "flag",
  "flag": "ln3r4b1l1ty}",
  "message": "\ud83c\udf89 Congratulations! You won part 3/3 of the flag!"
}
```
