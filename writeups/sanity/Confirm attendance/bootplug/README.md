## Challenge

Possibly the hardest challenge of EPT 2025.
For the last time, we ask you to confirm that you will attend Equinor CTF 2025.

## Process

EPT has been hounding players in their busy daily life to show sign of life and forseeing what they will be doing at 8th of November.
Personally I can't imagine what I will have for dinner tomorrow, let alone know where I will be 8th of November.
This challenge shook me to my bones, I needed to foresee the future and know that the stars aligned well enough to allow me to attend.
Luckily EPT is wise enough to train my senses by having a sequentional release of this challenge.

Throughout what seems like an eternity, they have been asking us to confirm attendance. 
I have clicked the button multiple times but to no avail recived a flag for it.
With my fleeting attention span, I employed a tactic that made the challenge solveable once on site.

After the CTF started, this challenge involved going to Discord, and to the discord channel verification.
Here you could click a button that would confirm your attendance for the last time, and auto submit the flag.
To ensure the ability to click the button, I employed attention grabbing tactics to make sure I could complete the task.
A short how to reenactment is shown below
